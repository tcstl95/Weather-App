# Weather-App

# Description

This is my Weather Application I have created by using the API data from OpenWeather. 

# Usage

This application is great for anyone who is looking to find the weather forecast in any U.S city during the week.

The application can be perfect for someone looking to plan special events like a vacation, wedding, parties, and more!

It can also be used for someone who just wants to know the 5 day forecast in their city.
